TRIP PLANNING WEB APPLICATION

    PlanMyTrip is a web application developed to assist users in efficiently planning travel routes across multiple 
locations by determining the sequence that results in the shortest total travel time. 
Users can input up to 10 destinations and customize key parameters such as departure time, 
mode of transportation (e.g., driving or walking), 
and preferences like avoiding toll roads. The system aims to offer flexible, real-world planning by 
taking user-defined constraints into account.The application features an autocomplete input powered 
by the Google Places API to ensure fast and accurate location entry. Once the user provides the necessary information, 
the system retrieves travel time and route data using the Google Maps Directions API. It then processes this data using 
the A* (A-Star) algorithm to determine the optimal visiting order. 
	Furthermore, it checks the opening and closing hours of each location using the Google Places Details API 
to eliminate infeasible routes based on time constraints. After processing, the application presents the most time-efficient 
travel plan first, along with route details such as place names, distances, and estimated travel durations.
A key feature allows users to open the entire optimized route directly in Google Maps via a generated link eliminating 
the need to re-enter destinations manually. PlanMyTrip is ideal for tourists, sales representatives, or anyone needing 
to visit multiple places in a single day, providing a streamlined, accurate planning experience accessible from any device.
This project aimed to propose a practical approach to applying web applications in travel planning. The results demonstrate
that the project successfully achieved its objectives: reducing the time required for travel planning and 
generating route sequences based on user-defined conditions. Moreover, the system was developed within the defined scope, 
including one-day trip support, responsive interface design, and efficient integration of Google Maps APIs. These outcomes 
confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of using web-based technologies for optimized travel planning.
